Portfolio Project README
------------------------
Aspects of the work that have been implemented correctly: 

-I have created the index.html, resume.html, and bio.html with the format and content requested in the specification. 

-I have used at least 1 CSS file, and it has more than 5 rules. 

-All of my filenames are in lowercase and contain only valid characters

-I have not used styling tags, styling attributes, frames, absolute URLs, front-end frameworks, JavaScript or jQuery. I have also not used other people’s CSS files, however, I did consult tutorials from W3 schools to help with different stylings. 

-All of my HTML and CSS pages pass the official validation on their respective websites.

-All of my content is stored in my github account’s special repo, in its master branch


People with whom I have collaborated or discussed the assignment:
-None, however, I did search for help with styling questions on websites such as W3 schools

Time I have spent completing the assignment:
-Approximately 6 hours

Other notes:
Some of my earlier commit messages are not quite as descriptive, as I forgot that I could check my work without pushing it to Github and so was pushing somewhat excessively. However, after I rediscovered that I could, my messages returned to being more meaningful.
