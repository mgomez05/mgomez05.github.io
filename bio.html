<h1>A Short Biography of Russ</h1>

<p id="bio-paragraph">Russ Gomez grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania as the son of two humble farmers. Despite their insistence on him taking up the family trade, he decided to try his luck with becoming a software designer, as he believed that might make him more money. After graduating from I Told You So University and working in the field for several years, he has become more confident in his life choice, and regularly sends his parents postcards of the fancy office spaces he works in (both have only been mildly impressed). However, he still appreciates the heritage and upbringing he came from, and so maintains a small but plentiful tomato farm in his backyard in Somerville, Massachusetts.</p>
